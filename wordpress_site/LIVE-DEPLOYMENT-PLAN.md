# First Data Security - Live Website Update Plan

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SAFETY MEASURES**

### **Pre-Deployment Backup (MANDATORY)**
Before making ANY changes to the live site, create a complete backup:

1. **WordPress Database Backup**
   ```bash
   # Via WordPress admin or hosting panel
   # Download complete database backup
   # Store backup file with timestamp
   ```

2. **File System Backup**
   ```bash
   # Backup entire WordPress directory
   # Include wp-content/themes/
   # Include wp-content/uploads/
   # Include wp-config.php and .htaccess
   ```

3. **Hosting Panel Backup**
   - Use AWS/hosting provider's backup feature
   - Create snapshot of entire site
   - Verify backup can be restored

## 🎯 **Current Site Analysis**
- **Platform**: WordPress on AWS (IP: 54.189.100.76)
- **Current Theme**: Blocksy v2.1.12
- **Focus**: Federal cybersecurity compliance
- **Target Market**: Government agencies and defense contractors

## 🔄 **Deployment Strategy Options**

### **Option 1: Staged Deployment (RECOMMENDED)**
1. Create staging environment
2. Deploy new theme to staging
3. Test all functionality
4. Deploy to production after validation

### **Option 2: Content-Only Update (SAFER)**
1. Keep existing Blocksy theme
2. Update only page content with new services
3. Add new service pages
4. Maintain current design framework

### **Option 3: Theme Migration (REQUIRES TESTING)**
1. Full backup (mandatory)
2. Deploy new custom theme
3. Migrate content carefully
4. Extensive testing required

## 📋 **Recommended Approach: Content Integration**

Given that you have a live, professional site, I recommend **Option 2** for safety:

### **Phase 1: Add New Service Content**
1. Create new pages for expanded services:
   - SOC 2 Fast-Lane (Type I Readiness)
   - SOC 2 Type II Managed Readiness
   - Trust Center Setup + Sales Enablement
   - Pen-test Coordination + Remediation
   - vCISO Services (Lite/Full)

2. Update homepage to include new services alongside existing federal focus

3. Update navigation to include new service categories

### **Phase 2: Content Enhancement**
1. Integrate new service descriptions
2. Add professional service pages
3. Enhance contact forms for new services
4. Update CTAs and conversion paths

## 🛠 **Safe Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Backup Everything**
```bash
# Create complete site backup
# Download database export
# Archive all theme files
# Save hosting configuration
```

### **Step 2: Content Preparation**
- Prepare new service page content
- Update homepage content to include both federal and commercial services
- Create service category organization

### **Step 3: Gradual Deployment**
1. Add one new service page at a time
2. Test each addition
3. Update navigation incrementally
4. Monitor site performance

### **Step 4: Testing Protocol**
- Test all new pages
- Verify existing functionality
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Validate contact forms
- Test all navigation links

## 🎯 **New Service Integration Plan**

### **Homepage Updates**
Expand the current federal focus to include:
- SOC 2 compliance services
- Trust center implementation
- vCISO services for private sector
- Broader cybersecurity governance

### **Navigation Structure**
