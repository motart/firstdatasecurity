<h2 class="wp-block-heading">📖 Our Story</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First Data Security emerged from Sac Associates, a Sacramento-based consulting firm with over a decade of experience serving government agencies and defense contractors. As cybersecurity compliance requirements evolved rapidly—CMMC implementation, FedRAMP expansion, Zero Trust mandates—our clients increasingly needed specialized governance expertise beyond traditional IT consulting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The turning point came in 2023 when NIST released Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 with its new "Govern" function. We recognized that most cybersecurity efforts were failing not because of technical inadequacy, but because of poor governance foundations. Organizations were implementing tools and controls without strategic alignment, clear accountability, or sustainable management processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditional cybersecurity consulting compounds this problem through endless assessments, generic frameworks, and scope creep that exhausts budgets without delivering implementable results. We saw the need for a different approach—focused sprints that deliver specific outcomes with clear timelines and fixed pricing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First Data Security represents our commitment to governance-first cybersecurity that aligns with mission objectives and operational realities. Every engagement focuses on practical implementation rather than theoretical frameworks, evidence-ready documentation rather than generic templates, and actionable roadmaps rather than aspirational strategies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🛡️ Leadership Philosophy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Effective cybersecurity requires mature governance structures that connect strategic objectives to operational implementation. Technology solutions without governance foundation create compliance theater—lots of activity but little sustainable risk reduction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our governance-first approach starts with leadership engagement, clear accountability structures, and strategic alignment before implementing technical controls. This foundation makes all subsequent cybersecurity investments more effective and creates sustainable compliance programs that adapt to evolving requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in honest assessment and realistic timelines. Not every organization is ready for every certification, and reactive compliance approaches often cost more than proactive governance investment. Our role is helping clients make informed decisions about cybersecurity strategy based on their current capabilities, resource availability, and business objectives.</p>
